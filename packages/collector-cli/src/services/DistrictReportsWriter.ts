/**
 * DistrictReportsWriter — persist the de-identified Daily Reports dataset
 * (epic #1062, Sprint 3 #1065) as a NEW separate file:
 *   `CACHE_DIR/snapshots/{date}/district_{id}_reports.json`
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the base `district_{id}.json` snapshot — it keeps
 * the daily-reports cadence + provenance distinct and NEVER mutates the base
 * (the overlay is applied at read time in Sprint 4). The new file is purely
 * additive, so it auto-promotes through the ADR-002 staging→diff→promote gate.
 *
 * The dataset is schema-validated before any bytes are written (a malformed
 * dataset must not reach GCS), and the district id is validated against path
 * traversal before it is interpolated into the file path (active tripwire:
 * never `path.join` raw input).
