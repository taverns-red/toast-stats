# Visual Audit — 2026-05-10 14:35

User feedback: **"the site is materially worse than we started"**.

I previously declared the redesign "complete" based on CSS class presence in the prod bundle. That was wrong — class presence ≠ visual fidelity. This document captures the real gap between the live deploy and the design handoff at `/Users/rservant/Downloads/design_handoff_toast_stats/`.

## Method

- Captured 1280×720 screenshots of all 5 routes from `https://ts.taverns.red/` via Playwright (`/tmp/live-audit/`).
- Compared side-by-side to designer screenshots (`screenshots/01..05.png`) and reference HTML (`designs/Toast Stats - *.html`).

## Universal defects (every page)

1. **Top bar nav layout is wrong.** Design centers the nav between the brand (left) and the icon-tools cluster (right). Live has brand-left + nav-right with no center column and no tools cluster.
2. **Missing top-bar action tools.** Design has bell icon, ? help icon, JS avatar pill on the right of the bar. Live has none of these.
3. **Nav items are wrong.** Design has 5 items: `Districts | Regions [SOON] | Awards [SOON] | History | Methodology`. Live has 4: `Districts Awards History Methodology` (no Regions; Awards is live, not "SOON"). The "SOON" disabled-with-badge styling is missing entirely.
4. **No "Toast Stats" wordmark consistency.** Design always shows the `TS` mark + the `Toast Stats` wordmark. Live ranges from showing it (History) to not showing it cleanly (Districts).
5. **Active-page indication.** Design active item uses a filled rounded-pill `--loyal-50` background. Live works on History but on Districts the active state appears unstyled (looks like all items are equal).

## Per-page defects

### `/` Districts (live screenshot vs design 01-districts.png)

1. **Action cluster missing.** Design has `Data fresh · Apr 26, 2026` pill + `↓ Export CSV` outline button + `↑ Share` filled-loyal button on the right of the page header. Live has just `Data as of May 9 · 9h ago` text — no buttons, no pill chrome.
2. **KPI numbers are too small.** Design `kpi-value` is 30px serif 800. Live is ~24px and feels lighter.
3. **Program-Year + Date selector + progress meter** are jammed into a single horizontal row with weird widths. Designer never showed these — they replace what should be the Awards Race + table chrome. The progress meter (`Program Year Progress 86% Jul 1, 2025 – Jun 30, 2026`) is not in the design at all and should be removed or relocated.
4. **Awards Race contender cards** are missing the progress-bar meter (a colored gradient line). Live has just text.
5. **Awards Race column subtitles** wrong wording. Design: `15 new charter strength clubs` / `+20 paid clubs vs prior year` / `90% retention of last yr clubs`. Live: `Largest net club growth` / `Highest % clubs with 20+ paid members` / `Top retention (≥90% paid clubs)`.
6. **`SORT BY:` and `REGIONS:` rows are unstyled raw text.** Design replaces these with a proper toolbar: a search input on the left, a segmented sort control in the middle, and region chips on a separate row below.
7. **Rankings table chrome.** Design shows a clean borderless table with mono numerics and a thin row separator. Live appears to have inherited the legacy table chrome (still cut off in the screenshot).

### `/district/61` District Detail (live vs 02-district-detail.png)

1. **Tab bar primitive is broken.** Design shows a horizontal tab strip with active-underline + count badges (`Overview | Clubs 305 | Divisions & Areas 7 | Trends | Analytics | Global Rankings`). Live renders the labels run-together as plain text: `OverviewClubs Divisions & AreasTrendsAnalyticsGlobal Rankings`. **Issue #359 was supposed to ship this — it did not.**
2. **Page header is cramped.** Design has Districts > District 57 breadcrumb on top, then the eyebrow `REGION 1 · PROGRAM YEAR 2025–2026`, then a large `District 57` heading, then the lede `Northern California — 305 active clubs across 7 divisions...`. Live mashes the breadcrumb + eyebrow + heading into a small column on the left.
3. **Action cluster** (Data fresh pill + PY select + date select + Export + Share) is partially present but visually disconnected — no group framing.
4. **Distinguished District Status panel** missing entirely from live. Design shows a panel with `Distinguished District Status` header + `On track — President's Distinguished` yellow pill + 4 award chips (Club Strength, Leadership, Education, Club Growth Officer).
5. **KPI numbers** truncated: live shows `MEMBER PAYM…#3 of` and `DISTINGUISHED (#2 of` — the rank-position chip is wrapping into the label and breaking the layout.

### `/district/61/club/00045123` Club Detail (live vs 03-club-detail.png)

1. **Live returns "Club Not Found"** because club 00045123 doesn't exist in district 61. The design uses `Walnut Creek Speakers` in D57. Need a valid club ID for visual comparison — but my code shouldn't have shipped this URL pattern in any docs.
2. **(Once a valid club is loaded)** the design shows: loyal-blue hero with `CLUB #00045123 · CHARTERED MAY 1982` eyebrow + huge `Walnut Creek Speakers` heading + `Area 04 · Division A · District 57` sub-line + right-side `· Thriving` pill + `Distinguished` outlined pill. Need to verify that against a real club.
3. **`CHARTERED MAY 1982`** part of the eyebrow is missing in our live hero — we have only `Club #<id>`. We need the charter date.

### `/history` History (live vs 04-history.png)

1. **Year strip chips look right** (active 2025-26 + LIVE green badge). This is one of the few near-correct surfaces.
2. **Per-year cards are missing** entirely (live admits this with `Per-year summary cards coming soon` paragraph). Design shows full per-year card with TOP 5 DISTRICTS list + HEADLINE METRICS column.
3. **Layout** is edge-to-edge — same centering bug as everywhere.

### `/methodology` Methodology (live vs 05-methodology.png)

1. **TOC card** is rendered but visually broken — no border / shadow framing on live, items are crammed close. Design has it inside a clean white card with proper spacing and the `01..08` numbering aligned to the right.
2. **Section headings** in the body are too tight against the body copy — design uses `01 Data source & access` with the number as a serif eyebrow before the heading.
3. **Layout** is edge-to-edge — same bug.

## Root-cause hypothesis

Most of the visual gap traces to two issues:

1. **The page-content max-width / padding wrapper is not consistently applied.** Districts has `.districts-page { max-width: 1280px; padding: 32px 24px; margin: 0 auto }` but other pages don't have an equivalent. The AppShell's `.app-shell__main { flex: 1 }` doesn't constrain width. So pages without their own constraint extend edge-to-edge.
2. **The `.app-shell-top-bar__inner` uses `justify-content: space-between` and just two children (brand, nav)** — there's no third "tools" cluster, so flex distributes brand-left + nav-right with no center weighting. Design uses three children (brand, centered nav with `flex: 1`, tools cluster) which produces the correct visual.

## Plan

I will not declare this complete again. The plan, in priority order:

1. **Fix the top bar nav** — three-column layout (brand | centered nav | tools cluster), add Regions [SOON] + Awards [SOON] disabled items, add bell + help + avatar tools.
2. **Add a universal page wrapper** — `.app-shell__page { max-width: 1280px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 24px }` applied to every route.
3. **Fix the District Detail tab bar** — actually render `#359` per the design.
4. **Districts page action cluster** — add Data fresh pill + Export CSV + Share buttons; remove the program-year-progress meter that isn't in the design.
5. **Awards Race progress bars** — add the progress-track + progress-fill meter line.
6. **Awards Race subtitles** — match design wording.
7. **Districts toolbar rebuild** — search input + segmented sort control + region chip row.
8. **District Detail "Distinguished District Status" panel** — new section with the on-track pill + award chips.
9. **History per-year cards** — needs new endpoint, deferred to its own issue.
10. **Methodology TOC card framing** — visual polish.

Each item gets its own focused PR with TDD discipline. No more bulk "I shipped 5 things" PRs without visual verification.

## What I will not do

- Declare anything "complete" until a Playwright screenshot of the live deploy has been compared, by me, to the designer's screenshot at the same viewport.
