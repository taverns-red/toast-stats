            <strong>Paid Clubs growth</strong> — sum of paid clubs across the

            one.
          </li>

            <strong>Payments growth</strong> — sum of total payments across the
            region's districts, divided by the sum of payment bases, minus one.
          </li>
          <li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Regions are ranked separately in each category. With N=14 regions,
          rank #1 in a category gets 14 points, rank #14 gets 1. The region
          <strong> aggregate score</strong> is the sum of points across the
          three ranks — a number between 3 and 42. This mirrors the district
          aggregate above so the framing transfers, and (unlike a raw sum of
          district scores) it{' '}

            <strong>Pre-2019 data</strong> — Toast Stats only stores snapshots
            from PY 2019–20 onward. Earlier seasons live in TI's own archive.

          <li>
            <strong>Mid-PY restatements</strong> — TI occasionally republishes
            corrected files. Toast Stats keeps the latest published version and
            does not back-fill prior days; small day-over-day deltas occur
            during corrections.

            <strong>Charter date parsing</strong> — historical charter dates in{' '}
            <code>district-performance.csv</code> use a 2-digit year format (
            <code>04/15/26</code>); the parser explicitly handles this. See{' '}
            <code>tasks/lessons.md</code> Lesson 47 for context.

            display computed values to one decimal place. Ties at that precision
            are broken by raw paid-club counts; the underlying ranking uses
            unrounded values.
