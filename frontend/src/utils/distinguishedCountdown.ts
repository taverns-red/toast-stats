/* Per-district countdown to the *minimum* Distinguished District tier.
   Folds three absolute "remaining" counts (paid clubs, payments,
   distinguished clubs) + two officer-award booleans from the
   competitive-awards JSON into a uniform shape the table cell renderer
   can consume (#688, epic #683 F4).

   The three numeric metrics used to render the percentage-point gap to
   the next tier; Amy wants the absolute count remaining to the minimum
   (e.g. "277 payments to go"), so they now carry a `count`.

   Data source (lesson 103 — derive the countdown from the same gate it
   counts down to):
   - prefer the canonical `*Remaining` fields (#686, post-pipeline);
   - else derive from the rankings row's program-year base + current
     counts with the SAME formula the analytics calculator uses, so the
     column renders correctly on a pre-pipeline snapshot and matches the
     canonical analytics value EXACTLY. We derive from the raw counts —
     not from `nextTierGap`'s gap % — because the payment/club growth
     percentages TI publishes are pre-rounded to 1 dp, so deriving from
     them drifts ±1 from the canonical field (and can flip met/not-met).
     The raw integer counts have no such rounding. */
