/**
 * Route-aware smart recovery resolver (#1012, epic #1010 Sprint 2).
 *
 * Sprint 1 (#1011) gave the branded error page generic Home + Back recovery.
 * This adds *contextual* recovery for the most common dead end: a malformed
 * `/district/:id/…` URL (e.g. `/district/61/dude`), which React Router treats
 * as an unmatched route (404). `useRouteError()` exposes no attempted URL, so
 * ErrorPage feeds us `useLocation().pathname` and the known district ids.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — all branching is unit-tested without a page mount (R22),
 * and ErrorPage stays a thin consumer (R3: the page owns the data, the
 * resolver only decides).
