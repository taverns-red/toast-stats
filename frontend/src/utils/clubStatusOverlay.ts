/**
 * Read-time club-status overlay (epic #1062, Sprint 4 #1069).
 *
 * During the month-end closing period the base club/division/district dashboards
 * freeze (the #309 closing logic, scrape↔snapshot date remap). The Daily
 * **Dues Renewal** report keeps moving daily and is program-year-keyed, so it
 * sidesteps that remap. This resolver augments a club's status at READ time from
 * the renewal report — it NEVER mutates the frozen base snapshot.
 *
 * Two non-negotiable rules (from the sprint charter):
 *   - **Promote-only.** The overlay may ONLY upgrade a club to `Active`, and only
 *     when its renewal status is `Verified complete - <date>`. It can never emit
 *     anything but `Active` (the top operational state), so it can never demote.
 *   - **Provenance-explicit.** Every augmented value carries its source + as-of
 *     date so we never silently blend two cadences into one number (the #800 /
 *     D61 150→151 multi-source hazard).
 *
 * Clean hand-off on un-freeze: once the base snapshot reports the club `Active`
 * itself, {@link resolveClubStatusOverlay} returns `null` (the base-Active
 * no-op), so the overlay yields to the authoritative base with no backward jump.
 *
 * @module clubStatusOverlay
