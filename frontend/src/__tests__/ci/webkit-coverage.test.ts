/**
 * Guard: WebKit/Safari verification coverage must stay wired (#713).
 *
 * #685 closed as "0 contrast violations" while /regions was unreadable in
 * Safari (#710) — verification was Chromium-only. #710 added a `webkit`
 * Playwright project; #713 formalizes it so the coverage cannot silently
 * regress:
 *   (a) the config keeps a `webkit` project bound to the smoke suite, and
 *   (b) the PR-preview CI workflow installs the WebKit browser AND runs the
 *       smoke against the live preview.
 *
 * (b) matters because a declared-but-uninstalled engine is INERT — the
 * webkit project resolves in config yet never executes (cf. lesson 082: a
 * rule can be present-at-error and still detect nothing). Assert the wiring
 * actually runs, not just that "webkit" appears somewhere.
