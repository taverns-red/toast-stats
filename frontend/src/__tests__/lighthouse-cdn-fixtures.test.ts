/**
 * Lighthouse CDN fixture validity guard (#915, epic #917 Sprint 4 — V10).
 *
 * The Lighthouse CI gate (`lighthouse-ci.yml` + `lighthouserc.js`) is decoupled
 * from network reachability by serving these committed fixtures from
 * `scripts/lighthouse-cdn-server.mjs` instead of the live CDN — so a CDN flake
 * can no longer push the `/` page into an error state and red the CLS budget on
 * luck (deep-dive §3 V10; Lesson 125).
 *
 * That decoupling is only sound while the fixtures stay schema-valid: if a
 * pipeline/contract change drifts the real CDN shape away from these files, the
 * served page would render an unintended terminal state mid-Lighthouse-run and
 * the gate would silently measure the wrong layout. This guard makes that drift
 * break loudly here (a fast unit test that runs in CI — ci.yml frontend vitest)
 * instead of silently in the gate.
 *
 * NOTE on enforcement surface: the typed imports below are a compile-time
 * contract, but `build:frontend`'s `tsc` uses `tsconfig.json`, which EXCLUDES
 * the test directories — so the prod build does not type-check this file (only
 * the non-CI `typecheck:test` does). The load-bearing CI guard is therefore the
 * *runtime* assertions: esbuild strips the types without checking them, so every
 * required field a drift could touch is asserted explicitly below.
