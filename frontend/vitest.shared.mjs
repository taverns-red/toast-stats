// Single source of truth for the vitest unit/integration partition (#482).
//
// Imported by BOTH vitest.config.ts (to define the projects) and
// scripts/check-test-projects.mjs (the partition guard). Keeping one
// definition means the guard can never drift from the real config.
//
// A test belongs to the `integration` project when it mounts a full page
// or <App/>, runs an axe-core accessibility scan, or exercises a
// multi-component journey — the heavy tests that saturate worker threads
// on a multi-core dev machine and made the old full-suite pre-push hook
// chronically flaky (see tasks/473-flaky-prepush-diagnosis-2026-05-11.md).
// Everything else is a fast, contention-free `unit` test.
//
// Convention for NEW heavy tests (so they auto-route to integration):
//   - page-mount tests        → src/pages/__tests__/
//   - multi-step journeys      → src/__tests__/integration/
//   - axe / a11y scans         → src/__tests__/accessibility/
//   - or name the file          *.integration.test.tsx / *.a11y.test.tsx
// The partition guard (`npm run test:projects:check`) fails if any test
// file lands in neither project, so a mis-placed test is caught in CI
// rather than silently dropping out of both gates.

// V8 (#914, epic #917 S3) — the worker-count policy, sourced once so the real
// vitest config and its guard test (src/__tests__/config/maxWorkers.guard.test.ts)
// can never disagree.
//
// The Sprint 1 deep-dive named `maxWorkers: CI ? undefined : 3` the single
// highest-leverage flake amplifier: `undefined` lets CI spawn one fork per core,
// so an oversubscribed runner converts ambient timing-sensitivity into 5s-timeout
// failures (contention, not a regression). Local dev was already capped at a
// fixed 3 forks; CI was unbounded. We now cap CI at 50% of cores — half the box
// stays free for the main thread + v8 coverage instrumentation, which is exactly
// the headroom that keeps fast tests under the 5s timeout. The calibrated CI
// baseline was already 0% at unbounded on a clean runner; the cap is the durable
// guard against a future oversubscribed/larger runner drifting toward the
// workstation stress ceiling (100% flake, 30.9→171.9s spread).
