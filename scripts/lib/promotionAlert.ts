/**
 * Promotion-Held Alert Evaluation — Pure Functions (#1073, epic #1072)
 *
 * The daily Data Pipeline writes staging first, then promotes staging → prod
 * only when BOTH gates allow it (`data-pipeline.yml`):
 *   - the COUNT gate (`steps.diff`)        — additive-only: blocks a subtractive
 *     change (staging has fewer ranked districts/dates than prod);
 *   - the VALUE gate (`steps.valuediff`, #1034) — blocks a re-derive that keeps
 *     the same dates/districts but changes VALUES, until an operator reviews
 *     them (`allow_value_changes=true`).
 *
 * When a gate refuses, the corrected staging data silently fails to reach prod
 * and the run still reports `success` — prod keeps serving stale content with
 * no alert (epic #1072; observed live 2026-06-01 when D61 showed 150 active
 * clubs on prod for 5 days while staging correctly held 151).
 *
 * These pure functions turn the two gate outputs + the value-diff report into
 * a decision: file/refresh a `promotion-held` issue (distinguishing the
 * operator-review-needed value gate from a possible-regression count gate), or
 * auto-close it on a promoting run. They also surface the staging-ahead signal
 * — overlap dates whose CONTENT differs — which the date-based freshness
 * monitor (#753) can't see because a held promotion leaves `latest.json`
 * current. No network/GCS I/O lives here so the decision is unit-testable; the
 * workflow supplies the fetched gate outputs and value-diff JSON.
