# Stuck-session liveness FUSION + attempt-tracking STATE for sprint-runner.sh
# (epic #933, Sprint 3 #930).
#
# Design: docs/design/sprint-runner-liveness-detector-2026-05-30.md §3–§5.
#
# Layers (sourced AFTER scripts/lib/sprint-runner-probes.sh, which this file
# depends on for probe_commit_age / probe_process / probe_log):
#
#   fuse_verdict <commit> <process> <log>
#       Pure: combine the three probe verdicts into one of
#       HEALTHY | SUSPECT | STUCK | HUSK. HUSK (conclusive single signal) wins;
#       >=2 STALL corroborate to STUCK; exactly 1 STALL is a SUSPECT (never
#       reaps — the false-positive guard); else HEALTHY. UNKNOWN is never STALL.
#
#   state_* — a tiny jq-backed JSON store at $RUNNER_STATE_FILE (default
#       $WORKTREE_BASE/.runner-state.json). Holds the one fact runner truth
#       cannot reconstruct after a reap: the per-issue relaunch attempt count.
#       Writes are atomic (mktemp + mv) and fail-safe: a missing or corrupt
#       file reads as "0 attempts", never aborting the runner under set -u.
#
#   evaluate_liveness <issue>
#       The sampling EDGE: runs the live commands (git / pgrep / ps / stat /
#       tail), feeds them through the three probes, and echoes the fused
#       verdict. The pure layers above keep every decision unit-testable; this
#       is the only part that touches the host, so it is exercised via the
#       hermetic tick integration test with mocked git/pgrep/ps.
#
# Sourcing this file only DEFINES functions — no side effects.

# Capped auto-relaunch: how many times a STUCK/HUSK sprint is reaped + relaunched
# before the runner escalates to the operator instead (design §5; operator
# decision 2026-05-29). Env-overridable so the regression harness can drive the
# cap branch without 3 real ticks.

# === Attempt-tracking state store ==========================================
#
# The attempt counter must survive the reap that destroys the worktree, the
# screen, and the logfile — so it cannot be derived from any of them. It is the
# single piece of genuinely durable runner-internal state (design §4.2).

# WORKTREE_BASE at source time).

# tick under set -u.

}

# _state_read → the store as JSON on stdout, or `{}` if missing/corrupt.
# Corruption resolves to an empty store (fail-safe: at worst a few extra
# relaunch attempts), never to an abort. One jq does validate-and-emit.
_state_read() {
  jq -e . "$(_state_file)" 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
}

# _state_write_atomic  (new JSON content as $1) → replace the store atomically
# (mktemp + mv rename). The caller computes the content and checks jq's exit
# BEFORE calling here, so a failed transform never reaches the file.

#   Reconcile the store down to the listed (live) issue keys, dropping entries

# === Sampling edge =========================================================
#
# evaluate_liveness is the ONLY part that touches the host. It samples the live
# commands, feeds them through the pure probes, and echoes the fused verdict.
# After it returns, the caller can read the per-probe breakdown from the
# LIVENESS_COMMIT / LIVENESS_PROCESS / LIVENESS_LOG globals (for logging and a
# future --status line). pgrep/ps are used over `screen -ls` deliberately —
# macOS `screen -ls` exits 1 even when sessions exist and silently inverts a
# pipefail predicate (R14/L089).
