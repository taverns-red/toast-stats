/**
 * Test-quarantine mechanism — Pure Functions (#913, epic #917 S2).
 *
 * A quarantine isolates a KNOWN-flaky test so a confirmed flake never silently
 * blocks the queue AND is never silently ignored. Quarantine ≠ delete / skip
 * (R1: no bypassing failing tests, no commenting-out): an entry is an explicit,
 * loudly-reported, *justified* record that traces back to the root-cause sprint
 * that will fix it. The list lives in frontend/test-quarantine.json:
 *
 *   { "quarantined": [
 *       { "file": "src/.../Foo.test.tsx",
 *         "test": "optional describe/it name",
 *         "reason": "why it flakes (cite the lesson/vector)",
 *         "issue": 914,                // tracking issue/sprint
 *         "since": "2026-05-28" }      // optional
 *   ] }
 *
 * These functions parse that file, enforce that every entry is justified
 * (file + reason + tracking issue), and render a LOUD report. The IO entrypoint
 * (read file, print, set exit code) lives in scripts/check-quarantine.ts.
