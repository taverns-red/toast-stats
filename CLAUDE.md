# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Toastmasters District Statistics Visualizer — a data visualization platform for Toastmasters district performance metrics. Live at https://ts.taverns.red.

**Monorepo with npm workspaces:**

- `frontend/` — React 19 + TypeScript SPA (Vite 7, TailwindCSS 4, Recharts, TanStack Query)
- `packages/shared-contracts/` — Zod schemas + TypeScript types (ESM + CJS dual export)
- `packages/analytics-core/` — Analytics computation engine (~58K lines)
- `packages/collector-cli/` — Data scraping CLI (Commander, csv-parse, GCS)

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev:frontend              # Vite dev server on port 3000 (proxies /api to :5001)

# Build
npm run build:frontend            # TypeScript check + Vite build
npm run build:shared-contracts    # Build shared types (must build before frontend)
npm run build:analytics-core      # Build analytics engine

# Testing
npm run test                      # Run all workspace tests (vitest --run)
npm run test:frontend             # Frontend tests only
npm run test:collector-cli        # Collector CLI tests only
npm run test:analytics-core       # Analytics core tests only
npm run test:coverage             # All tests with coverage (55% threshold)
cd frontend && npx vitest --run src/__tests__/SomeTest.test.tsx  # Single test file

# Linting & Formatting
npm run lint                      # ESLint all workspaces (max 500 warnings)
npm run lint:yaml                 # Lint GitHub workflows and docs YAML
npm run format                    # Prettier write
npm run format:check              # Prettier check only

# Quality gate (runs typecheck + lint + yaml lint + format check + tests)
npm run quality:check

# Pre-commit hook (typecheck + lint + yaml lint)
npm run pre-commit
```

## Architecture

**Data flow:** Collector CLI scrapes Toastmasters dashboards → transforms + computes analytics → uploads to GCS as CSV/JSON snapshots → Frontend reads pre-computed snapshots from CDN via TanStack Query (5-min stale, 10-min GC).

**Frontend structure (`frontend/src/`):**

- `pages/` — 3 lazy-loaded routes: LandingPage, DistrictDetailPage, ClubDetailPage
- `components/` — UI components (tables, charts, cards, modals)
- `hooks/` — Custom hooks (`useDistrictAnalytics`, `useTimeSeries`, `usePaymentsTrend`, `useColumnFilters`, etc.)
- `services/` — CDN/API service layer (`cdn.ts`, `cdnTimeSeries.ts`)
- `contexts/` — Global state (ProgramYearContext, DarkModeContext)
- `utils/` — Utility functions (CSV export, DCP calculations, styling)
- `styles/` — Tailwind CSS layers + component CSS

**Styling:** Tailwind 4 with CSS layers. Dark mode via `[data-theme='dark']` CSS scope. Opacity variants (`text-tm-*-80`) bake in hardcoded rgba and must be overridden explicitly — they don't inherit CSS variable overrides.

**Deployment:** Frontend → Firebase Hosting. Backend → Cloud Run (Docker). Storage → Firestore + GCS. CI via GitHub Actions.

## Debugging & Bug Fixes

When fixing bugs, always trace the issue to its root cause in the backend/pipeline before applying any frontend workaround. Never apply cosmetic fixes without confirming the underlying data flow is correct.

## Testing

Never lower test coverage thresholds to make CI pass. Always write the missing tests instead. Maintain TDD discipline throughout all sprints.

## Refactoring

After any refactor or dead code removal, run the full test suite AND do a manual smoke check of affected services before committing. Never remove code that other modules depend on without verifying imports.

## External APIs & Integrations

Always verify API parameters against official documentation before using them. Do not guess parameter names, voice identifiers, language codes, or formality options for third-party APIs (Deepgram, DeepL, Edge-TTS, Google Cloud STT, etc.).

## Git & Deployment

When using parallel agents or worktrees, always check for merge conflicts before finalizing. Never auto-merge without diffing against the current branch tip.

## Engineering Rules (from `tasks/rules.md`)

Read `tasks/rules.md` completely before every task. Key rules:

- **R1** — Never bypass failing tests. No `--no-verify`, `--skip-tests`, assertion pinning, or commenting out tests.
- **R2** — GitHub Actions runners start empty. All data must be explicitly synced from GCS.
- **R3** — Pass program year/date/filters as props from parent. Never re-derive from API response data.
- **R4** — CLI logging: `console.error()` only (stderr). Stdout is for structured JSON output.
- **R5** — Read the last 5 entries in `tasks/lessons.md` before starting any task.
- **R6–R8** — Trace call graphs before refactoring; inventory existing fields before adding new ones; audit full read+write paths when deleting services.

## Active Tripwires

- `SnapshotBuilder.build()` has two district-tracking code paths (success + validation-failure) — must update both.
- DCP goals are **independent**, not sequential. Use `clubPerformance` raw fields, never infer count as Goals 1-N.
- Chart `|| 1` range fallback causes y-axis inversion. Pad symmetrically when `range === 0`.
- `Path.join()` with raw user input = path traversal. Always call `validateDistrictId()` first.

## Learning Artifacts

- `tasks/lessons.md` — Append-only log of discoveries (38+ entries). Read last 5 before each task.
- `tasks/rules.md` — Curated high-signal rules distilled from lessons. Read completely before each task.
- `docs/product-spec.md` — Shipped features, business rules, product decisions.

## Key Conventions

- **Prettier:** 80 chars, single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, no implicit any. Zero TS errors required for CI.
- **Filter pipeline pattern:** `original → filtered → searchFiltered → sorted`. Add new filters as steps, don't replace existing ones (R11).
- **CSS pattern for cross-cutting concerns:** Override at CSS level (`[data-theme]`), not component level (R10).
- **GCS-backed store pattern:** Sync from GCS → upsert → save → push back. See `ClubTrendsStore` and `TimeSeriesIndexWriter` as reference implementations (R9).

## Workflow Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task

1. Read the last 5 entries in `tasks/lessons.md` (R5).
2. Read `tasks/rules.md` completely.
3. Create or identify a GitHub issue (`gh issue create` or `gh issue list`). All commits and PRs must reference the issue number.
4. Use `EnterPlanMode` for any task requiring >3 steps.
5. If root cause is unknown, run an experiment using `tasks/experiment_template.md` in a canary file first.

### Implementation Loop (TDD)

1. **Red** — Write/run a test that fails for the right reason → commit
2. **Green** — Write the minimal code to pass the test → commit
3. **Refactor** — Clean the code while tests stay green → commit
4. **Verify** — Run the full test suite to confirm zero regressions
5. Repeat. Never skip or combine steps.

### Commit Discipline

- Commit every 15–30 minutes of active work. Each commit = one logical change.
- Every commit message must reference the tracking issue (e.g., `feat: add validation (#42)`).
- Follow conventional commits. Never batch unrelated changes.

### Definition of Done

**Lightweight DoD** (≤1 file, no business logic/tests/API changes):

- No assertion pinning. All pre-existing tests pass. Codebase is releasable.

**Full DoD** (everything else):

- Failing test existed before the fix. Targeted tests now pass. No assertion pinning.
- All tests pass. Zero regressions. CI/CD green. Live verification passes.
- Change is single-responsibility. Dead code and experiment files deleted.
- At least one insight added to `tasks/lessons.md`.

### Hard Stop

If "Green" state cannot be reached in 3 iterations: revert all changes, document why the hypothesis failed, ask the user for architectural clarification.

## Specialized Agent Personas

Activate the relevant persona when work matches its trigger. Read the SKILL.md file at the listed path, then apply its framework throughout the task.
