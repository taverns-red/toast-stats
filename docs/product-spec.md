## What We're NOT Building

| Item                      | Reason                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User authentication       | All data is public; no user-specific features needed                       |
| Real-time updates         | Daily pipeline is sufficient; real-time adds complexity with no user value |
| Mobile app                | Responsive web app covers mobile use cases                                 |
| Club-level editing        | Read-only analytics; data comes from Toastmasters dashboard                |
| Multi-district comparison | Focus on single-district depth; global rankings serve comparison           |
